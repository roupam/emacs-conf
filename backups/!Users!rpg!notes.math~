Ordering complex numbers
------------------------

If a and b are real numbers, one can have an ordering relation on
them, that assigns them certain properties.
Such as a < b w.r.t L(0,inf)

This ordering relationship has certain properties
For example:

  a < b and b < c implies a < c (transitivity)
  a < b implies b > a
  a < b implies a + c < b + c

and some other similar and elementary properties

Now, how do we abstract this concept out...
How do we have an order relation for complex numbers ??

Think of it this way... what is an order relation?
It is nothing but a way to indicate motion or direction on the real number line...

Fix a point on the real number line (say 0)...
At a given speed it will take more time for a point to move from 0 to 2 than 0 to 1...

Now imagine this. Suppose there is a spiral starting from the
origin. If we make the spiral tight enough, we can approximate "almost every"
point on the complex plane. If someone were to start traversing the
spiral starting from the origin, then w.r.t. the spiral, we can get an
order relation for "almost all" complex numbers.

Suppose the spiral is so tight, that we can approximate it by infinite
number of concentric circles. Then, we can get a sense of distance
using:

s(z) = pi*r^2 - 2*pi*r + r*t, where z = r*e^it and 0 <= t < 2*pi

And we can have order relations for complex numbers if z1 < z2 if
s(z1) < s(z2)

This is just one way of looking at it. The idea is to develop and
implement ideas from real analysis under a given context of order
relations.
