\section{Getting the library}
\label{sec-1}
\section{Intructions for version 0.1.1 Helpshift iOS library}
\label{sec-2}
\subsection{To download the library you must be logged on as an admin}
\label{sec-2-1}
\subsection{Goto home and click on ``DOWNLOAD LIBRARY'' to get the zip file}
\label{sec-2-2}
\subsection{The zip file contains}
\label{sec-2-3}

   -> Helpshift.h header file
   -> libHelpshift.a static library
   -> a folder containing the images required by the library. HSResources/
\section{Adding the library to your project}
\label{sec-3}

Adding the library to your project is simple. Just unzip the zip file
you have downloaded, and drag and drop all its contents to your XCode
project. Make sure that in the ``Build Phases'' of your target
application Helpshift.h is in ``Copy Headers'', libHelpshift.a is in the ``Link Binary with
Libraries'' and the pngs are in ``Copy Bundle Resources''.  That's it,
Helpshift is now integrated with your project.
\section{Authentication tokens}
\label{sec-4}

  -> API Key : This is your developer API Key
  -> Domain Name : Please put your domain name without any \href{http://}{http://} or forward slashes
  -> App ID : This is the unique ID assigned to your app

When initializing Helpshift you must pass these three tokens. You
initialize the library by adding the following lines in the
implementation file for your app delegate, ideally at the top of
`application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`


\begin{verbatim}
[Helpshift install:@"5a867e6b07466faa939285508de33a42" :@"sandbox.helpshift.mobi" :@"sandbox_platform_20120726120113072-89b012748d5aa10"];
\end{verbatim}

The first argument is your API Key, second is the domain name and the third
argument is your App ID. This is all that you'll need to initialize Helpshift.
\section{Additional Configuration (optional)}
\label{sec-5}

Additionally you can configure/pre-define certain user information, so
that the user does not have to go through filling up their name/email
again (provided you have them). For example:


\begin{verbatim}
[Helpshift setUsername:@"John"];
[Helpshift setUseremail:@"john@helpshift.com"];
\end{verbatim}

Also if you already have unique indentification for your users,
you can specifiy those as well. For example:


\begin{verbatim}
[Helpshift setUserIdentifier:@"user-id-100"];
\end{verbatim}

These are optional methods. If you do not have these information you
do not need to put it. But they will help you in identifying your
users and managing them in the backend.
\section{Showing support screen}
\label{sec-6}

To show the Helpshift support screen you need to pass the name of the
viewcontroller on which the support screen will show up. For example
from inside a viewcontroller you can call Helpshift support by
passsing the argument ``self''


\begin{verbatim}
[[Helpshift sharedInstance] showSupport:self];
\end{verbatim}
\section{Notification count}
\label{sec-7}

Also if you want to show your user notifications for replies on the
issues s/he has posted, you can get a notification count. This count
will always be string. You can get the current count by using:


\begin{verbatim}
NSString *currentCount = (NSString *)[[Helpshift sharedInstance] notificationCount];
\end{verbatim}

\end{document}
