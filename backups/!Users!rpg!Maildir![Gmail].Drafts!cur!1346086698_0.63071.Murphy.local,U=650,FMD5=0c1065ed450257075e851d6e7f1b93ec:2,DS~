Subject: Emacs email client

I have tried mew, gnus, etc. clients before.

I came across mu4e (mu for emacs) and just tried this out
http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html
Its worth taking a look at.

The search thingy, autocomplete addresses, etc. are real nice.
Initial setup was a bit time consuming, because I had to download all mails from
GMAIL using offlineimap.

But the client worked exactly as mentioned in its docs.
The gmail configuration was easy, hardly any modifications needed.
