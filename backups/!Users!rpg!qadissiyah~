al-Qadisiyyah

When it was over...
Dead bodies scattered all around...
Freedom bleeds...
and No one to rescue it...

He comes, he rises, he bows to the sun...
He will take vengeance...

But it was more than that...
The unsung heroes will be forgotten now...

Now, after many years...
And as the valtari comes...
The dead shall rise again...
The pain will be remembered again...
And blood shall be smeared with blood...

They will fall, they will be thrashed...
Their bones shall become dust...

The mothers who lost their sons...
The sons who were lost to the accursed...
Shall come back home...
