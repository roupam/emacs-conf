I am Neha Aggarwal...
Being a girl I can do so many things with my body....
I have grown breasts.
I have pierced my ears... twice in both ears...
I can wear salwar kameez of T-shirts and jeans...
Men always stare at me, and my awesome boobs...
I can only imagine what they would like to do with my body
I can wear  panties and bras...
I get to have my periods...
I can feel my breasts and my nippples...
I have felt how it feels to push a baby out of your body...
I have felt how it feels to give milk and nourish an infant...

I can divide my experiences into few parts:
 * Piercing and self-exploration
 * Dresses that I can wear
 * Marriage and social pressure
 * Shopping with my friends
 * Rape, Rape and Nautanki
 * Multiple Creampie
 * Used and impregnated
 * Pregnancy and childbirth
 * Taking care of my babies and having more babies
 * More...

Piercing and Self-exploration
