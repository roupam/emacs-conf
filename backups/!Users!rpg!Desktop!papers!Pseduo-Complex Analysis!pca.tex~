\section*{Introduction}
The Riemann zeta function must be one of the most widely studied
functions in mathematics. It is not hard therefore to imagine that
there is a lot of interesting formulas that mathematicians have come
up with to describe this function. The function is sort of an unifying
underlying concept in many areas of mathematics. Arising from complex
analysis its properties have been applied in the fields of number
theory, and even as far as physics. Clearly there is a lot of
information hidden in this function, and which if revealed will shed
light on all these areas.

\bigskip In what follows is a study of the zeta function extended to a
class of numbers (what I call as pseudo-complex numbers) and using
some interesting results we shall shed light on Riemann's long
standing hypothesis.

\bigskip I am deeply indebted to the people who supported me and
encouraged me to go on. My gratitude also goes to my family for their
continued interest in whatever I was doing.

\section*{A Brief Background}
The Riemann zeta function was first introduced by Riemann as the
analytic continuation of the sum, given by the Euler product formula
over primes
$$\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s} = \prod_{p}
\left( 1 - \frac{1}{p^s}\right)^{-1}$$ In his seminal 1859
paper, Riemann gave the functional equation for zeta thereby extending
it to the entire complex plane
$$\pi^{-\frac{s}{2}} \Gamma\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)\zeta(s) =
\pi^{-\frac{1-s}{2}} \Gamma\left(\frac{1-s}{2}\right)\zeta(1- s)$$
From such a scenario Riemann gave an explicit formula relating the
non-trivial zeros of $\zeta(s)$ with that of a modified form of the
prime counting function
$$J(x) = Li(x) - \sum_{\rho} Li(x^\rho) - \log 2 + \int_{x}^{\infty}
\frac{dt}{t(t^2-1)\log t}$$ This of-course shows how important the
study of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function is. But this
example is not the only one.  There are many proofs in modern
mathematics, that start with \textit{"If the Riemann Hypothesis is
  true ..."} As of now, the Riemann hypothesis stands unsolved.

\section*{Pseudo-Complex numbers}
Let's define a number $j$ with the following properties \newline
1. $j^2 = 1$ \newline 2. $|z_1 + jz_2| = |z_1| + i|z_2|$ where $z_1$
and $z_2$ are complex numbers, $i$ being the imaginary unit, and $|z|$
denotes the absolute value of $z$.

\bigskip So basically, you can think of $j$ as the imaginary number
whose absolute value is $i$. Immediately we shall have formulas like
$$|a + ib + jc + ijd|^2 = a^2 + b^2 - c^2 - d^2$$
where $a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{R}$, and for $z \in \mathbb{C}$
$$e^{jz} = \cosh(z) + j\sinh(z)$$

\noindent Also, more importantly we can write for $\sigma,t,w \in
\mathbb{R}$
$$|x^{\sigma+it+jw}| = x^\sigma$$

In what follows we shall investigate the Riemann zeta function
extended to the pseudo-complex numbers. The results are similar and
different. But most importantly a version of Riemann hypothesis will
be proved for pseudo-complex numbers.

\bigskip We shall denote the complex part of any pseudo-complex number
$v = s_1 + js_2$ as $C(v) = s_1$ and the pseudo part as $P(v) = s_2$,
where $s_1$ and $s_2$ are normal complex numbers. If $P(v) \in
\mathbb{R}$ then we say that $v$ is a pure pseudo-complex number,
otherwise we consider $v$ impure.

\bigskip For the number $ij$ we consider it an imaginary number of the
third kind. With $j^2 = 1$ we get $\frac{1}{j} = j$, $\frac{i}{j} = ij$,
$\frac{j}{i} = -ij$ and $\frac{1}{ij} = -ij$.

\subsection*{Pseudo-holomorphic functions}
Just like the definition of holomorphic functions, we can extend the
definition to pseudo-holomorphic functions. Consider the quotient,
where $p_0$ is a pseudo-complex number, $$\frac{f(p_0+h) - f(p_0)}{h}$$
If the quotient converges to a limit when $h \to 0$, then $f$ is
pseudo-holomorphic.

\subsection*{Cauchy-Riemann equations and analytic continuation}

Cauchy-Riemann equations are important in the sense, if a
complex-valued function follows those equations then it is holomorphic
and from it we can deploy the powerful tools of complex analysis like
analytic continuation. In the case of pseudo-holomorphic functions,
such equations will help us bridge the gap between complex and
pseudo-complex analysis, and instead of reinventing the wheel we can
use already existing tools.

\bigskip Consider a pseudo-holomorphic functions for impure
pseudo-complex arguments $x,y,z,w \in \mathbb{R}$, ie., $f =
f(x+iy+jz+ijw)$ then if we write it as $$ f = p + iq + jr + ijs $$ We
can derive the corresponding Cauchy-Riemann equations as

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} &= \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} +
i\frac{\partial q}{\partial x} + j\frac{\partial r}{\partial x} +
ij\frac{\partial s}{\partial x}\\
\frac{1}{i}\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} &= -i\frac{\partial p}{\partial y} +
\frac{\partial q}{\partial y} - ij\frac{\partial r}{\partial y} +
j\frac{\partial s}{\partial y}\\
\frac{1}{j}\frac{\partial f}{\partial z} &= j\frac{\partial p}{\partial z} +
ij\frac{\partial q}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial r}{\partial z} +
i\frac{\partial s}{\partial z}\\
\frac{1}{ij}\frac{\partial f}{\partial w} &= -ij\frac{\partial p}{\partial w} +
j\frac{\partial q}{\partial w} - i\frac{\partial r}{\partial w} +
\frac{\partial s}{\partial w}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent Comparing we get,
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
& \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial q}{\partial y} =
\frac{\partial r}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial s}{\partial w}\\
& \frac{\partial q}{\partial x} = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial y} =
\frac{\partial s}{\partial z} = -\frac{\partial r}{\partial w}\\
& \frac{\partial r}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial s}{\partial y} =
\frac{\partial p}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial q}{\partial w}\\
& \frac{\partial s}{\partial x} = -\frac{\partial r}{\partial y} =
\frac{\partial q}{\partial z} = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial w}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent For pure pseudo-complex arguments $x,y,z \in \mathbb{R}$
ie., $f = f(x+iy+jz)$ we can similarly have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
& \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial q}{\partial y} =
\frac{\partial r}{\partial z}\\
& \frac{\partial q}{\partial x} = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial y} =
\frac{\partial s}{\partial z}\\
& \frac{\partial r}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial s}{\partial y} =
\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}\\
& \frac{\partial s}{\partial x} = -\frac{\partial r}{\partial y} =
\frac{\partial q}{\partial z}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

For the first system of equations we can conclude from the
Cauchy-Riemann equations that an impure pseudo-holomorphic function is
holomorphic in $(x,y)$,$(y,z)$,$(z,w)$ and $(x,w)$ planes [1]. For the
second system of equations similarly we can say that a pure
pseduo-holomorphic function is holomorphic in $(x,y)$ and $(y,z)$
planes. From this we can conclude that if $f=g$ in some domain of the
pseudo-holomorphic space, then $f$ and $g$ are identical throughout
(analytic continuation).

\bigskip In the following sections we shall deal only with
pseudo-holomorphic functions with pure pseudo-complex arguments,
unless otherwise specified.

\section*{Pseudo-complex functions}

\subsection*{The Gamma function}
For pseudo-complex numbers $v = s+jw$ where $s \in \mathbb{C}$, $w \in
\mathbb{R}$ and $\Re(s) > 0$ we define the Gamma function as
\begin{equation}
\Gamma(v) = \int_0^\infty e^{-x}x^{v-1}dx
\end{equation}

This function converges absolutely for $\Re(s) > 0$, and follows from
the standard definition of the Gamma function for complex numbers.

\subsection*{The Riemann zeta function}
\textbf{Lemma:} For pseudo-complex numbers $v = s+jw$ where $s,w \in
\mathbb{C}$ and $\Re(s-w) > 1$ we shall have
\begin{equation}
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^v} =
\frac{1}{2}(\zeta(s+w)+\zeta(s-w)) + \frac{j}{2}(\zeta(s+w)-\zeta(s-w))
\end{equation}
\textbf{Proof:} For $\Re(s-w) > 1$ we have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  & \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^v} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty
  \frac{1}{n^{s+jw}}\\
  & = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n^w + n^{-w}}{2n^s} - j\sum_{n=1}^\infty
  \frac{n^w - n^{-w}}{2n^s}\\
  & = \frac{1}{2}(\zeta(s+w)+\zeta(s-w)) + \frac{j}{2}(\zeta(s+w)-\zeta(s-w))
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Hence for $\Re(s-w) > 1$ we define the Riemann zeta function
as
\begin{equation}
\zeta(s+jw) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^{s+jw}}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{The Dirichlet eta function}
We define the Dirichlet eta function for pseudo-complex numbers in a
similar way as that of the zeta function before. For $\Re(s-w) > 0$
\begin{equation}
\eta(s+jw) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n^{s+jw}}
\end{equation}

\noindent Immediately, we can derive that for $\Re(s-w) > 0$
\begin{equation}
\eta(s+jw) = \frac{1}{2}(\eta(s+w)+\eta(s-w)) + \frac{j}{2}(\eta(s+w)-\eta(s-w))
\end{equation}

\noindent It is infact straight forward to show that
\begin{equation}
\eta(s+jw) = (1 - 2^{1-s-jw})\zeta(s+jw)
\end{equation}

\subsection*{The functional equation}
Using Riemann's second method [2] for finding the functional equation of
the Riemann zeta function we can show that for a pure pseudo-complex
number $v$ we get

\begin{equation}
\pi^{-v/2}\Gamma\left(\frac{v}{2}\right)\zeta(v) =
\pi^{-(1-v)/2}\Gamma\left(\frac{1-v}{2}\right)\zeta(1-v)
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Zeros of the zeta function}

From the functional equation it is clear that if for a purely
pseudo-complex number $\zeta(v) = 0$ then so is $\zeta(1-v)$. Also
from the relation of the Dirichlet eta function to that of zeta we
shall have the same conclusion for that of the eta function. We shall
work with the eta function since its valid for $\Re(s-w) > 0$ instead
of $\Re(s-w) > 1$ for the zeta function definition above. Now if
$\eta(s+jw) = 0$ we must have from equation (9) that $\eta(s+w) +
\eta(s-w) = 0$ and $\eta(s+w) - \eta(s+w) = 0$ ie., $\eta(s+w) =
\eta(s-w) = 0$.

\bigskip This is indeed a strong condition. Obviously, $0 < \Re(s - w)
< 1$ and $0 < \Re(s+w) < 1$ for such zeros. Now if $s = \sigma + it$
then we shall have
\begin{equation}
\eta(\sigma+w+it) = \eta(\sigma-w+it) = 0
\end{equation}

\noindent If $w \neq 0$ then it implies $\sigma+w = 1 -
(\sigma-w)$ ie., $\sigma = \frac{1}{2}$

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Note} that this does not prove the Riemann
hypothesis, but instead proves a version of the hypothesis for
pseudo-complex numbers. The original Riemann hypothesis is the case
for $w=0$, and still remains unproved. But our result gives a strong
hint towards it, since as $w \to 0$ the value of $\sigma$ still
remains $\frac{1}{2}$, and I believe the zeta function will not be
that irregular that it breaks off at $w=0$. But again, there are
always great surprises when it comes to maths.
