In this article, we shall describe some of the most interesting
topics in the subject of Complexity Science for a general audience.
Anyone with a solid foundation in high school mathematics (with some
calculus) and an elementary understanding of computer programming
will be able to follow this article. First, we shall explain the
significance of the $P$ versus $NP$ problem and solve it. Next, we
shall describe two other famous mathematics problems, the Collatz
$3n+1$ Conjecture and the Riemann Hypothesis, and show how both
Chaitin's incompleteness theorem and Wolfram's notion of
``computational irreducibility'' are important for understanding why
no one has, as of yet, solved these two
problems.
